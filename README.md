### The Coding Train (where the ToyNeuralNetwork library came from!)

#### Neuro-Evolution Flappy Bird

Here is the first part in a 4-part series:

#### Color Classifier in TensorFlow.js:

This series has a lot to it, first crowd-sourcing data with firebase, then using tensorflow.js to build the model and ultimately make predictions interactively

#### XOR with TensorFlow.js

Turns out, solving XOR is a big deal because it's a non-linear problem and was a limitation of the precursor to Neural Networks, the Perceptron, which couldn't solve this.

#### The Essence of Calculus

This series endeavors to take the viewer as someone who's never heard of calculus and educate them enough to have invented it in the first place. Audacious and informative!

## COURSES

### Andrew Ng's ML course

This is the course that the ML club ran through initially. This covers many areas of machine learning, and only briefly on Neural Networks. If you want to have fundamentals solidified, it's a great course!

### Fast.AI

This is what the ML club is currently working through. It's a practice-first applied deep learning course that you do on your own time.
